# μTox XP - The lightgweight tox client

μTox is a privacy-oriented chat client, based on the [c-toxcore](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore) library which uses P2P encrypted communication to ensure confidentiality on conversations. It supports audio and video calls, file sharing, and even group chats!

After the original developers decided to remove support for the Microsoft® Windows XP operating system, we decided to create this variant to keep offering updated releases of this software for those who still prefer to use the good old XP. 

μTox supports multiple platforms, including Linux, Macintosh, BSD and Android, however, this fork is only intended for windows users. If you are really interested on other platforms, better check out the [original project](https://github.com/uTox/uTox).
